Hi there. I wrote this little program to help with adding entire cycles worth of cards to CubeCobra.

So far, there are only land cycles, and the UI is pretty scuffed, and it only works by compiling the main.py file.

Let me know if you find this thing useful and whether you want me to expand its features :)
